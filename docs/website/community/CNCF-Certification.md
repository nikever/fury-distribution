### Benefits of a certified distribution

The [CNCF] helps to build a community around open source container software, and has established the Kubernetes Software
Conformance Certification to fulfil that goal. Certified Kubernetes solutions are validated by the [CNCF] they check
that versions, APIs, and such are all correct, supported, and working as expected so users and developers can be assured
their Kubernetes-based solutions will work with ease, now and in the future.

- **Consistency**: users want consistency when interacting with any installation of Kubernetes.
- **Timely Updates**: to remain certified, vendors need to provide the latest version of Kubernetes yearly or more
  frequently, so you can be sure that youâ€™ll always have access to the latest features the community has been working
  hard to deliver.
- **Confirmability**: any end-user can confirm that their distribution or platform remains conformant by running the
  identical open source conformance application (Sonobuoy) that was used to certify.
