## Why is KFD open source

Kubernetes fury distribution is an open source project. The distribution of both core modules and addons, the cli and
the installers are fully available in the official repositories. Our commitment is to provide transparency as an added
value. As in the cryptographic lanscape, there is no use to copyright the code we create since we all are standing on
the shoulders of giants, and we are grateful.

## Registered trademark

We really love how we make things, so if you want to deriver from our work is perfectly fine but you may not use the
names of the original company or its members to endorse derived products. We will need to give explicit permission to
do so. As a rule of thumb by using the Fury landscape youÂ´re required to follow the licensing restrictions of the
project.

## Collaborate with us

Usigng the project allows you almost unlimited freedom with the software so long as you include the [BSD copyright
and license](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-distribution/blob/master/LICENSE) notice in it. The project are provided
"as is", so the software/license owner cannot be hold liable for damages of any kind.
